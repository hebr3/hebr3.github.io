#lang Pollen

◊(define-meta title "About")

I am mostly using this site as a platform to experiment with static blogging using ◊link["https://racket-lang.org/"]{Racket} and ◊link["http://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/"]{Pollen}.

I used Joel Dueck's blog ◊link["https://thenotepad.org/"]{The Notepad} as a starting point for this site. He has all of his code avalible on ◊link["https://github.com/otherjoel/thenotepad"]{github}.
