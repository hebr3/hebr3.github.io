## Week 2 Case Study
[With Big Data Comes Big Responsibility](https://hbr.org/2014/11/with-big-data-comes-big-responsibility)

This weeks case study examines an article from the Harvard Business Review concerning the current and future usage of smart devices and the collection of personal data.

In the article Professor Alex Pentland from MIT shares some of his observations and concerning about the sharing habits individuals and views concerning the collection of personal data. Reading this article with an eye towards cybersecurity issues I found that the Professor touched on two topics that should be examined more closely.

First is the issue of business ethics as it relates to the collection and storage of personal data, especially biometric data. While sales teams and designers are constantly thinking of new ways to monetize user data, care has to be taken to consider the long term costs of storing personal user data. It isn't a stretch to consider that the biometric and locational data being collected by smart devices is nearly equivalent to medical data. While the laws might not be in place currently, I expect that eventually this data will be classified with medical data and require similar protections and regulations. A company jumping that decides to start collecting personal data from IoT devices has to consider that this data might have strong regulations place on it one day. If a company is trying to market specialty device they need to consider exactly how much data they really need to collect and store.

The second issue I see with the collection of personal data is related to its long term storage. There have been a number of security breaches related to personal data. These breach are a result of there being different entities that are willing to purchase user data for use in targeted marketing and analytics. Having a collection of user data on your service increases the risk of being targeted for this user data. A company needs to consider the cost of securing and storing personal user data when creating their business plans. Does that data being stored represent more potential profit to the company that liability.

Many people enjoy having analytic data for their activities. Being able to present users with detailed breakdowns of data they are interested in and being able to share that data represents a real business opportunity. Companies just need to properly account for the costs related to these projects before they start making long term investments.
