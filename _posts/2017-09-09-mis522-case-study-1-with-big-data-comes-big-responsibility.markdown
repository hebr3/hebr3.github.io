[With Big Data Comes Big Responsibility](https://hbr.org/2014/11/with-big-data-comes-big-responsibility)

This weeks case study examines an article from the Harvard Business Review concerning the current and future usage of smart devices and the collection of personal data. I will be using [Self-determination theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory) (SDT) as a lens to view this topic.

In the article Professor Alex Pentland from MIT shares some of his observations and concerning about the sharing habits individuals and views concerning the collection of personal data. Reading this article we can see areas where individual desires to collect and share personal data aligns with the motivating factors of SDT. This theory can also help to explain why individuals are reluctant to over share data.

The use of smart devices to collect and store personal data can be closely linked to the SDT desire for competence. Graphs and data give users clear metrics by which to gauge growth and mastery of activities. Having a smart device monitor and track performance during physical activities allows individuals to quantify performance quickly and accurately. Personal data collection can directly lead to reinforced views and behaviors in regards to personal heath and training.

The sharing of personal data and accomplishments can be linked to the SDT desire for relatedness. Smart devices allow people to easily collect and share information with others. Being able to view and compare personal performance and accomplishments with peers increases the perceived connection to the group. Smart devices also assist with the need for inclusion as individuals receive notifications and updates concerning the activities of others.

Data collection also relates to the SDT desire for autonomy. While having the ability to view and analyze data is important for competence, the belief that these activities are being influenced by others decreases autonomy. If the perception develops that the activity is being done for the benefit of others the motivation to allow for the collection of data decreases. Specifically, if an individual feels that their data is being used for marketing or statistical analysis they could feel that they are being used as a product and quit the service. Individuals regularly quit and boycott services that they feel are unfairly leveraging they data or time in relation to their perceived gains.
