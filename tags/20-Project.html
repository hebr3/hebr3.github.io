<p>Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:</p>

<p>n² + n + 41</p>

<p>It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 39. However, when n = 40, 402 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41, and certainly when n = 41, 41² + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.</p>

<p>The incredible formula n² − 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.</p>

<p>Considering quadratics of the form:</p>

<p>n² + an + b, where |a| &lt; 1000 and |b| &lt; 1000</p>

<p>where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n e.g. |11| = 11 and |−4| = 4</p>

<p>Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.</p>

<p>From Project Euler</p>

<hr />

<p>Initially I planned to tackle this problem from a strictly brute force perspective. I have found that working on a simple solution to a problem usually gives me insights to more elegant solutions.</p>

<p>Therefore I figured that the most straight forward and inelegant method was to produce a 1999 by 1999 array with individual elements of the array corresponding to the maximum number of consecutive primes generated by that combination of a and b.</p>

<p>Thus the initial element of the array in position |1,1| would be the maximum number of consecutive primes generated by n² + (&ndash;999)n + (&ndash;999), and the final position of |1999,1999| would be n² + (999)n + (999).</p>

<p>With this plan in mind I tried to think up a quick way to calculate the maximum number of consecutive primes for a given a and b.</p>

<p>I started by having Mathematica generate the first 101 values from the example given in the problem by using a=1 and b=41.</p>

<p>ProjectEuler-Mathematica01</p>

<p>I then used PrimeQ to test whether each value was prime.</p>

<p>ProjectEuler-Mathematica02</p>

<p>Then used Boole to convert these true false values to 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>ProjectEuler-Mathematica03</p>

<p>And finally FirstPosition to find the first false in the list.</p>

<p>ProjectEuler-Mathematica04</p>

<p>Note that the answer of 41 corresponds to the 39 primes listed in the example since this method doesn&rsquo;t count the primes from 0&ndash;39 but from 1&ndash;40 and it found a non-Prime number in position 41.</p>

<p>So&hellip;</p>

<p>This method is horribly inelegant, however it also does work so it&rsquo;s time to see if I can use this method to generate the 1999 by 1999 array I initially planned for.</p>

<p>I begin by trying a smaller array and seeing if my method works.</p>

<p>ProjectEuler-Mathematica05</p>

<p>Note that this entry should be much larger as it displays a 51 by 51 array of values.</p>

<p>To find the maximum element of this array I then use the Position and Max commands. Position gives the location in an array of a specified value, and Max gives the largest element of the array.</p>

<p>ProjectEuler-Mathematica06</p>

<p>Since we are counting up from 0 we have now found that the Maximum number of consecutive primes is generated with a=1 and b=41 which matches the example.</p>

<p>One area of concern going forward is that it takes 0.655204 secs for Mathematica to create the 51 by 51 array I used above. Since a 1999 by 1999 array is nearly 1600% larger than a 50 by 50 array that means that generating a 1999 by 1999 array should take at least 17 minutes and 28.33 second. Most likely longer considering that the edges of the array will be dealing with a and b values greater than 900.</p>

<p>Still I have free time and I&rsquo;m not paying for processing time so we might as well go forward and see how long it takes.</p>

<p>ProjectEuler-Mathematica07</p>

<p>So 21 minutes and 14 seconds later we have our array and can try to find the Maximum number of consecutive primes.</p>

<p>ProjectEuler-Mathematica08</p>

<p>And we have a max at |939,1971|, so 939&ndash;1000=&ndash;61 and 1971&ndash;1000=971 are are a and b values.</p>

<p>a*b=&ndash;61*971=&ndash;59231</p>

<p>And we thus have our answer for Problem 27.</p>

<p>Now how could we have improved this process.</p>

<p>We could start by recognizing that b has to be a prime number. It was only after I had finished this problem that I realized that since n starts at 0 the first element will always be 0*0 + a*0 + b. Since there are 168 primes less than 1000 that means I only needed 168 rows instead of 1999.</p>

<p>A 1999 by 168 array is 8.4% the size of a 1999 by 1999 array and only took Mathematica 1 minute and 56 seconds to calculate.</p>

<p>ProjectEuler-Mathematica09</p>

<p>A larger time sink is that I am actually calculating out the first 100 n values for every combination of a and b tested. Thus even if the second value calculated is non-Prime I still waste time evaluating the next 98 values.</p>

<p>Using the following code I can just check if the n values are prime and stop when a non-Prime is found.</p>

<p>ProjectEuler-Mathematica10</p>

<p>To better understand how much time this saves, I calculated a 50 by 50 array using the old method and the new method and had Mathematica generate an ArrayPlot to save space.</p>

<p>ProjectEuler-Mathematica11</p>

<p>The second method took 6.1% of the time taken by the first method.</p>

<p>Using both methods together the entire process of generating the 1999 by 168 array takes 10 seconds.</p>

<p>ProjectEuler-Mathematica12</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t looked into it, but I suspect that I could similarly shave a couple of seconds off of the total running time by finding some trick for picking a values.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>I started by creating a rather inelegant method for finding the number of consecutive primes generated on a 1999 by 1999 matrix. This method took 21 minutes and 14 seconds.</p>

<p>I next examined the problem more closely and found areas that could be refined so that I found that same solution in 10 seconds.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m confident that the majority of the improvement in performance came from optimizing the operation that found the number of consecutive primes.</p>

<p>ProjectEuler-Mathematica13</p>

<p>Using the above code I found that 280607 times the second number tested was non-Prime. Since there are only 336000 entries in the array that means that 83.5% of the time while generating the original array I could have stopped after calculating the second value.</p>

<p>This was a longer write up than I originally expected, but it was a rather involved problem that benefited greatly from optimization.</p>
