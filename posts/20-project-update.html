<p>Considering Prof. Heil’s email I have complied a list of the criteria for my 20% Project.</p><p>For my 20% Project I’m going to be learning to write code in <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> to find solutions for the problems posted on Project Euler.</p><h2>1 What are you going to learn (what is your “learning target”)?</h2><p>For my 20% Project I’m going to be expanding my knowledge of coding by learning to write code for Mathematica. As a student at CSUSM I currently have access to Mathematica through cougarapps and I feel that I would be remiss to not give it a try while I still can. I also think that Mathematica might be a better fit for some of the mathematical problems that are in the Project Euler database.</p><h2>2 How are you planning on learning it? (part of this learning must take place online)</h2><p>I plan to learn this through online video instructions, tutorials, and the documentation provided inside of Mathematica.</p><h2>3 List your 10 authentic questions for inquiry. . .you only need the questions. The answers will come at the end of the project)</h2><p>Does Mathematica have enough built in tools to do this task?<br/>Does my knowledge of C++ transfer to Mathematica?<br/>How long will it take to get competent with Mathematica?<br/>How difficult is it to create functional algorithms in Mathematica?<br/>Are there coding considerations I should be aware of when working with Mathematica?<br/>How difficult of a task have I set for myself?<br/>Are there classes of problems that are more difficult with Mathematica?<br/>Can these problems be adjusted for use in the classroom?<br/>What mathematical fields are covered by this project?<br/>How much does Mathematica cost if I decide to keep using it after this project?</p><h2>4 What will a successful outcome look like (what is your “success criteria”)?</h2><p>I would consider success for this project to be the completion of at least the first 50 problems on the site.</p><h2>5 (Most importantly) Is there an aspect of play and/or making in your project. Is there an opportunity for failure? It is important that you avoid pure knowledge pursuits for this project.</h2><p>I enjoy completing logic puzzles like Sudoku and I have previously been working on some of these problems on this site for fun in my spare time. So I think that this project has an element of play for me.</p><p>I get satisfaction out of solving problems that are difficult, also I like reading over the different methods used by other people after I have completed a problem.</p><p>I’m not sure how much opportunity for failure is presented by this project. I know that even if I don’t finish 50 problems by the end of this course I will eventually finish them. However I would like to reach this goal if I could, even if it’s just as a personal pride thing.</p><h2>6 Which tool are you going to be using for research? (I know there was a request for more clarification on tools. We can do this Monday)</h2><p>I’m going to be using the internet for most of my research on this project.</p><p>While I know some Professors and Computer Science majors at the University who I could talk to about coding these types of problems, I’m rarely on campus this semester so it would be difficult to stop by and ask them for assistance.</p>
