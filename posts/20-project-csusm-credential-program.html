<p>For my 20% Project I am thinking about expanding my coding skills. I took a basic computer programming class with C++ during college and I want to expand that knowledge.</p><p>I’ve been able to solve around 10 of the problems on <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> using the coding skills that I already know and some Combinatoric trick however, I have come to recognize that to move any further I am going to need to learn how to actually write complex computer code utilizing arrays and date structures. I haven’t settled on a specific language to learn for this project, however I would like to finish the first 100 problems on the site by the end of the semester.</p><p>I find that many of the problems I have already solved have a range of possilble solutions ranging from brute force to elegent mathematic proofs. I feel that going through these problems will give me a greater appreciation for the diverse methods students use to solve mathematical problems in my class. Understanding that a problem can have more than one valid solution and being able to articulate how different solution methods can arrive at the same answer is an important skill that we need as teachers. Hopefully this project will assist me in recognizing and articulating that to students.</p>
